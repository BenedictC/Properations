# Properations

Properations is a concurrency framework. It provides:
- Future and promises based concurrency
- Integration with `(NS)Operation` infrastructure

There are a handful of existing open source projects that implement futures and promises. The unique feature of Properations is that it is built on existing concurrency components of Foundation meaning that the implementation is relatively small and thus easier to understand and extend. 

The following projects provide similar functionality to Properations. These projects have different implementations and interfaces but the underlying concepts are identical to Properations and so the documentation is may prove useful as an introduction:
- [BrightFutures](https://github.com/Thomvis/BrightFutures/blob/master/README.md)
- [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Documentation/README.md)
- [Promises](https://github.com/google/promises)
- [Promise](https://github.com/khanlou/Promise)
